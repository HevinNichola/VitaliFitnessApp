While the chicken is cooking, prepare the romaine lettuce by washing and chopping it into bite-sized pieces. Place the chopped lettuce in a large salad bowl.

Add the grated Parmesan cheese to the bowl with the lettuce. Once the chicken has rested, slice it into thin strips or cubes.

Add the sliced chicken to the salad bowl. Drizzle Caesar dressing over the salad, tossing gently to coat the lettuce and chicken evenly.

Optional: Add cherry tomatoes, sliced avocado, and cooked bacon bits on top of the salad for extra flavor and texture.
